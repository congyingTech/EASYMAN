# EASYMAN

### Introduce

EASYMAN is a simple blog engine based Flask, it's easy to use, so I name it as EASYMAN. <p>
This Blog Engine has two parts, one is EASYBLOG, another is EASYPOSTS.
-  EASYBLOG   
This Part is core of EASYMAN, you can set your own conf in folder named conf, there are some parameters you need to
configure, such as TEMPLATE_DIR, POST_DIR, TITLE, AUTHOR_NAME, DB_CONFIG,etc. If you think my template is very ugly and you happen 
to a front-end engineer, just create your own perfect page and put them in the template directory.
-  EASYPOSTS
This place is where your markdown files are stored. If you are not a Python  programmer, you can just put your md-post in this 
directory.
